====TODO:====
--MAJOR PROBLEM: why don't the clutter objects appear in the camera capture imgs???
    -they spawn fine and show up in rqt_img_view...
    -Make sure that it's not somehow capturing earlier (pre-clutter) frames.
        -- spawn an object which is there only when no clutter is present.
  -- Updating to Gazebo 8 did not fix this problem.

-"extract_images.py": set dataset filepath with cmd line args.

-Clean up print statements.

-ValueError on node shutdown-- trying to dset.close() on a closed dataset.

-Try to reduce thread sleep time between adding clutter and taking image.
-   How low can we go?

-Clutter: instead of spawning+removing objects each time, spawn all of them
-       at the start and then move them in/out of the camera view as needed.
-       Could save a lot of time.

-See TODO's in the code.

==== Longer-term TODOs ====
-Proper dir existence checking

-Make background texture a parameter.

====DONE:====
Finish labling balls
Find transform from world to gastank.  Put balls in gastank frame.
-Test everything so far.  Debug.  See TODOs in code.
-Write dataset code.
-Test everything together.
-Generate dataset.
-Scale of gastank.  It's multiple meters.
-Create textured gastank.
-COMPRESS images.
-       SEE: https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/745#issuecomment-259646466
- Fix keypoint, regen datasets.
- Cluttered scene.
- Load keypoints from meshlab .pp file.
-Make proper node for model_views.py, with parameters for texture options, 
        dest dirs, etc.
